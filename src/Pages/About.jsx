                Hi, my name is Lauren. 
                I'm a web developer with a passion for coding. 
                I have experience working with a variety of technologies and languages. 
                I'm always looking to learn new things and improve my skills. 
                When I'm not coding, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, hiking, knitting, and doing yoga.
            </p>
        </div>
